# start page maker

Create a startpage, where you just need to press a single key to open the page you want.

## howto

Place the pages you want to include in `config.json` run `go run main.go > made.html`.

Once you have opened the page, press the key assinged to the page to open it in a new background tab. Want to open it in the current tab? Press shift+key. This means, you cannot assign upper case and lower case of the same letter to different pages.
